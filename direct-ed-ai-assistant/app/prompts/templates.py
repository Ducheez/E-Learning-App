  - For 'intermediate' difficulty: Provide a comprehensive answer that covers the main aspects of the topic. Assume the user understands the basics.
  - For 'advanced' difficulty: Provide a nuanced, technical answer. Focus on complex details and assume the user is an expert.
- If the user_type is 'instructor': Provide a thorough, well-structured summary suitable for a lesson plan. It should be detailed enough to anticipate and answer potential student questions.
