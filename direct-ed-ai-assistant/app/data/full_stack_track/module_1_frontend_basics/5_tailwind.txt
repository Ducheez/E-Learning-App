Title: Tailwind CSS Explained

---
## 1. What is Tailwind CSS?
---

**Tailwind CSS** is a popular, modern CSS framework that takes a **"utility-first"** approach to web design. Instead of providing pre-styled components like buttons and cards, Tailwind gives you a vast set of low-level, single-purpose **utility classes** that you can use to build completely custom designs directly in your HTML.

* **Analogy: LEGO Bricks vs. a LEGO Kit ðŸ§±**
    * **Traditional Frameworks (like Bootstrap):** Are like a pre-designed LEGO castle kit. You get pre-built components (a wall piece, a tower piece) that you assemble. It's fast, but your castle will look similar to everyone else's.
    * **Tailwind CSS:** Is like a giant box of individual LEGO bricks of every shape and color. It doesn't give you a pre-built wall; it gives you the tiny bricks (`bg-blue-500`, `p-4`, `rounded-lg`) to build any kind of custom wall you can imagine.

## 2. The "Utility-First" Workflow
---

The core idea of Tailwind is to stop switching between your HTML and a separate CSS file. You apply styles by composing utility classes directly on your HTML elements.

**Traditional Approach (HTML + Separate CSS):**

**HTML:**
```html
<button class="btn-primary">
  Click Me
</button>
