Title: HTML5 Explained

---
## 1. What is HTML5?
---

**HTML5** is the fifth and latest major version of **HTML (HyperText Markup Language)**, the standard language used to create and structure the content of web pages. It's the fundamental building block of the modern web.

Think of HTML as the **skeleton of a webpage** ðŸ¦´. It provides the basic structure and defines the different parts of the page, such as headings, paragraphs, images, and links. HTML5 is a significant evolution of this language, introducing new features to support modern web applications, multimedia, and more descriptive page structures.

## 2. The Main Goals of HTML5
---

HTML5 was designed to achieve several key goals that its predecessors couldn't:

* **Richer Semantics:** Introduce new tags that describe their content's meaning, not just how it looks. This is crucial for both search engines (SEO) and accessibility.
* **Built-in Multimedia:** Make it easy to embed video and audio directly into web pages without relying on third-party plugins like Adobe Flash.
* **Enhanced Interactivity:** Provide native support for graphics, offline capabilities, and better user input forms.
* **Improved Compatibility:** Standardize how browsers interpret and render web pages, reducing inconsistencies and the need for browser-specific hacks.

Here are some of the most important features that HTML5 introduced:

### **Semantic Elements**
Instead of using generic `<div>` tags for everything, HTML5 provides specific tags for common page sections. This makes the code cleaner and more meaningful.

**Before HTML5 (using `div` tags):**
```html
<div id="header">...</div>
<div id="nav">...</div>
<div class="article">...</div>
<div id="footer">...</div>
